              I started my journey in development way back in high school, where
              I had an interest in developing websites. I remember that I built
              a website for my favorite artist, Daft Punk, during that time and
              also built a blog which revolved in news about gaming. However, my
              first exposure to web development was during my elementary years,
              where I was taught how to develop a simple website using HTML and
              CSS and deployed it using a free hosting service.

              During my college years, I delved deeper into computer science
              during my time in the University of the Philippines Mindanao. I
              learned about data structures, algorithms, neural networks,
              machine learning, cybersecurity, and software engineering
              (fullstack development in web, mobile, and software projects
              involving JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, C, C++, C#, Java, and
              Python).

              My thesis paper focused on the usability and user experience
              analysis of the TrabaHanap mobile application. The methodology I
              used was the System Usability Scale (SUS) and User Experience
              Questionnaire-Short (UEQ-S) to evaluate the usability and user
              experience of the app and the impact of the implementation of
              local cultural elements on the app. While conducting my thesis, I
              developed my skills in mobile development, and also learned about
              the importance of user experience and usability in the development
              of a software application.
